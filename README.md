MixLyrics is a web application that uses Musixmatch API to search for lyrics. 
On the search screen, just type the song name with the artists name, you will get the lyrics of the song.

P.S: I have used Free plan of MusixMatch API so only 30% of the lyrics is displayed. For complete lyrics I need to use a commercial plan.
